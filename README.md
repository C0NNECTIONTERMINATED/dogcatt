omori, twf, fnaf(not in the fandom), ln + vln and sf are some of my interests(i have a few more, just ask)

doing this because i'm too lazy to make a rentry or carrdðŸ¤·

i like indie horror stuff, i'm open to game/show/movie suggestions

selective mutism, anxiety and autism + possibly ADD but i haven't been diagnosed yet

idk if not being in the fandom means i cant make cosplays of the show/game/movie but i honestly dont gaf so
